## Dave Engine
Dave Engine is an engine that started out as originally a Kade Engine modification, but has since
turned into its own complete separate engine! This engine contains many powerful features including:

- Modding Support [via Polymod](https://polymod.io/)
- Script Events powered by HScript
- Custom Character Select
- Language Support
- Custom Runtime OpenGL Shaders
- Many more!

## Compiling
Inside the project's root folder, you'll see 2 files:
- **libraries_install.bat**
- **libraries_update.bat**

Run **libraries_install.bat** to install all of the necessary libraries needed to compile the project.
